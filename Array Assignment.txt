4)Disadvantage of arrays:-
  ....once we create the size cannot be increased/decreased
  ....it stores only homogeneous data elements

5)An array without any name (or reference) is called an Anonymous
Array. They are useful for the scenarios where we need one time
usage of Array.
For example,
Anonymous int array :
new int[] {2,3,4,5,6,7};
Anonymous String array :
new String[]{"Java , "Hungry"};

6)using for loop & for each loop


7)The length variable in an array returns the length of an array i.e. a number of elements stored in an array.

The length() method is a static method of String class.
